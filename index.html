							The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi
							in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan
							commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his
							capital from Agra to Delhi.
						</p>
						<p>
							Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
							constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah
							Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal
							Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the
							British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
